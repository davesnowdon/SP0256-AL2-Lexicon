SP0256-AL2 Lexicon

This project is an extends the functionality of the [SpeechChip Arduino library created by Jacob Field](https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Vintage-Speech-Chip/).  The SP0256-AL2 Lexicon program uses a large dictionary--the [CMUDict](https://github.com/cmusphinx/cmudict) created for the [CMUSphinx](https://github.com/cmusphinx)--to translate user entered sentences into words and then into allophones for use with the SP0256-AL2 speech chip.  The Lexicon program creates an Arduino .ino file to upload to an Arduino as shown in the [Arduino Speech Chip project by Jacob Field](https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Vintage-Speech-Chip/).

It's not 100% perfect, given that there are allophones the SP0 does not support, so you may have to change a few allophones in the output file to dial things in.  That being said, for anyone trying to get their RadioShack speech chips to crank out full sentences it's certainly a time saver.  The code should also be adaptable to other similar speech chips, like the insanely expensive Votrax chips.
