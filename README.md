SP0256-AL2 Lexicon

This project is an extends the [SpeechChip Arduino library created by Jacob Field](https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Vintage-Speech-Chip/).  The SP0256-AL2 Lexicon program uses a large dictionary--the [CMUDict](https://github.com/cmusphinx/cmudict)--created for the [CMUSphinx](https://github.com/cmusphinx)--to translate user entered sentences into words and then into allophones for use with the SP0256-AL2 speech chip.  The Lexicon program creates an Arduino .ino file to upload to an Arduino as shown in the [Arduino Speech Chip project by Jacob Field](https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Vintage-Speech-Chip/).
