SP0256-AL2 Lexicon

This project is an extends the [SpeechChip Arduino library created by Jacob Field](https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Vintage-Speech-Chip/).  My goal is to a large dictionary--the [CMUDict](https://github.com/cmusphinx/cmudict)--created for the [CMUSphinx](https://github.com/cmusphinx), and write a small program that searches the dictionary for words listed by the user, then compiles and uploads the necessary words to the Arduino.
